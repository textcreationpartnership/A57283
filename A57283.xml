            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conference ſhe ſeemed to be much affected, and leaſt that which then appeared to take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on her minde, ſhould ſlippe out of her memory, ſome grounds by way of a Dialogue were ſhortly written down, with ſeveral whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Chriſtian admonitions; this ſhort dialogue was by her put into the hands of a traffiquing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt, and in ſtead of her Converſion ſo much deſired, eight ſheets of paper are ſtuffed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, not only on it, but on the Goſpel-doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, which is according to Godlineſs, and all the profeſſours thereof. Ere I heard any ſuch thing, this pamphlet was ſpread with artificial inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and quickly convoyed from hand to hand for a time, at laſt a well wiſher to the truth ſent a copie to me, with this deſire that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

with ſilence, becauſe I thought diſcerning men would eaſily eſpy its weakneſs. Thereafter hearing that ſome Popiſhly enclined did magnifie it, leaſt the reformed Doctrine ſhould ſuffer prejudice, I was advyſed to pen a Reply with this reſolution, that except ſome new arguments be brought forth, which are not anſwered by reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, or here by me, I will not trifle my time ſo much allotted for better work, as to debate more on the ſubject here contained. What is ſaid, may (to my uptaking) ſatisfie ſuch as love the truths of the Goſpel, and in reaſon convince gain-ſayers. But if men will undervalue the word of GOD, right reaſon, and ſhutting their eyes, declare them ſelves unſatisfiable, an evil humour hath cauſed them to erre. And I have other imployment, not to wreſtle with ſuch. Wiſdom will be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her own children. And in this time when prophanneſs and Popery walk on every ſide, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he who keepeth his garments clean, and doth nothing againſt the truth, but for it. Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prieſts are very diligent, ſowing their cockle amongſt us in this land, they have their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, proxies, and procutors. Is it not then the dutie of good Chriſtians, to arme themſelves with the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of GOD, and keep their ground againſt adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? The face of truth is beautiful, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſouls precious. This ſhort Tractat is claiefly calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Dundee;</hi>

and for any ſingle ſincere Chriſtian, who ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly labour for Goſpel truths, and to worke out their own Salvation. All ſuch cannot have leaſure to read voluminous books, written by more able pens, nor will they be at the expences to buy them; and it may be alſo that ſome would not comprehend or reliſh them, <hi>mediocriter docta, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocriter doctis placent,</hi> ſaith the writter of the life of <hi>Pelicanus.</hi> Books are like meats, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of ſuitable ſympathie, contributeth to make them edifying; if this convince, convert, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh men in the truth, it is the bleſſing of the GOD of truth, for which I ſhal bleſs his Name. If not, it is my teſtimony to that truth wherein I have lived, and hope in the ſtrength of Ieſus Chriſt to die. So farr I'le endeavoure to ſerve my generation, this will be my peace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the event be; and my conſcience is witneſs that I hazard to publiſh this debate for no ſelfiſh end, or any other reſpect whatever.</p>

world<hi>!</hi> May not this render Popery ſuſpicious to any knowing man, that the abettors thereof decline the written word of GOD, to be the ſole umpire of faith and manners, and endeavour to diſcredit it before the Nations, which is the touch-ſtone of truth, and beſt fence we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan and all his complices; ſuch <hi>non ſunt audiendi,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Aug.

            <p>Their ſecond device, when they are preſſed with the truth, is to coin evil grounded diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with this ley money to make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of poor ſimple ſouls. Needle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>headed men have ſtrangely acted their inventions herein, and cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled Goſpel truths thus, that he is now thought the beſt and moſt learned Papiſt, who can findout ſubtile ſubterfugies, and receptacles againſt plain Scripture verities. So that the Romaniſts are the great foxes which eat up the tender vines. Other Sectaries who ſeparat themſelves from the Church builded on the foundation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. and deface the doctrine which is according to Godlineſs, are of leſſer magnitude. That ye may know what ſort of proppes uphold their rotten building, take theſe five inſtances. <hi>First,</hi> When we prove <hi>that the Scripture is the rule of faith,</hi> this they grant in part, but ſay they it is a partial, not the total rule; they muſt ſowder ſomewhat of their own tradition to it, erre they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for a rule. This is a reaſonleſs ſhift. If
<pb facs="tcp:60150:9"/>
the rule be not total and perfect in its own kinde, for its own ends, it is no rule at all, but a ſemi-rule, <hi>regula nec appoſitionem nec ablationem admittit, ſaith Theophilact, on the</hi> 3. <hi>chap. to the Philip.</hi> Nothing can be added to, or taken from a rule; the law of nature, the law of reaſon, are ſufficient for their own ends; ſo is the written word of GOD for ſalvation. When we ſay, <hi>Secondly, that the word of GOD cannot have authority from men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture is judge of the Church, and not the Church of the Scripture.</hi> They anſwer by a leaden diſtinction, that it hath authority from the Church in reſpect of us, but not in reſpect of it ſelf. This is a reaſonleſs evaſion, for all authority is an act, <hi>quoad extra,</hi> and relative to us. The Scriptures have excellency and dignity internal, but all its authority is external and relative to men. So that diſtinction is null. If the Scripture hath its authority from the teſtimony of their Church, then their faith muſt be ultimatly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into their Church teſtimony, as more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative nor the word of GOD. <hi>Propter quod u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numquodque eſt tale, illud ipſum est magis tale.</hi> Therefore Popiſh faith by this maxime is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but eccleſiaſtick and humane: Now the Church and faith of Believers ſhould be builded immediatly upon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Ieſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. Therefore the Pope with his traditions cannot found the Church, nor
<pb facs="tcp:60150:9"/>
the faith of Chriſtians; other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. To this they returne a diſtinction, that Ieſus Chriſt is the principal, and the Pope the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary foundation; ſeeing it was ſaid to <hi>Peter, upon this rock I will build my Church.</hi> This ſubterfuge in like the reſt; if this was ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> perſonally, as <hi>Tertul. de praeſcrip.</hi> thinketh, then not to his ſucceſſours, ſuppoſe the Pope were the man, a perſonal individual prerogative is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable. If it was not perſonal, but to him and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, then if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> were living, the Pope behoved to be above him in dignity and Church prerogative, by reaſon <hi>Peter</hi> was above him, and he ſucceedeth to his ſuperioritie. This to any diſcerner may appear abſurd. Beſide the Church is builded on the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. then not upon one Apoſtle, take the words as ye will. The true meaning of theſe words, <hi>upon this rock I will build my Church</hi> is this, the confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ieſus Church, the Son of the living GOD, was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This interpretation is authorized by <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth the words thus, <hi>Tract. ult. in Iohan. &amp; ſerm.</hi> 13. <hi>de verbis Apoſt.</hi> he giveth alſo ſtrong reaſon for it, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>retract cap.</hi> 21. <hi>non enim dictum eſt Petro, tu es petra, ſed tu es Petrus.</hi> which reaſon <hi>Valentia</hi> challengeth in vain, <hi>disp.</hi> 1. <hi>to</hi> 3. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>punc.</hi> 7. Further, there c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nnot be two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
<pb facs="tcp:60150:10"/>
if we ſpeak properly. If no man can lay another as the Scripture ſpeaketh, why ſhould it be aſſerted? Chriſt Ieſus alone ſet forth in the doctrine of Prophets and Apoſtles, is that ſolid foundation on which we build all our ſalvation; he is that ſure foundation laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> and no wayes can this without blaſphemie be applyed to the Pope, ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> maketh application of it to Chriſt only, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When we aſſert with the Scripture, <hi>that Marriage is honourable amongſt all,</hi> therefore they ſhould not forbid it. Their anſwer is, that <hi>all</hi> ſhould not be taken here abſolutely, for then a brother might marry his ſiſter, but only of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not prohibited, and their votaries are ſuch. Is not this a fig-leaf covering? Inceſt is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the law of GOD. But where are Church men forbidden by GOD to marry, it is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable among them ſaith the written word; who can bind men to the contrar of that which the Lord hath permitted and commanded? The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion about the Sacrament of the Supper is of the ſame kind; when it is objected that Chriſt ſaid expreſly of the Cup, <hi>drink ye all of it.</hi> By <hi>all</hi> ſay they, is meaned all Prieſts, but not all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Is this to be endured with patience, to ſee men tear ſo the ſenſe of Scripture with ſophiſms. If <hi>(all)</hi> relate to them as Miniſters of the Goſpel, then they ſhould have the bread only, and all privat Chriſtians ſhould be barred<hi>:</hi> for he who ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:60150:10"/>
               <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> ſaid likewiſe to the ſame <hi>(all) take eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, When they are challenged of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolarrie, by breach of the ſecond Command, here there is a diſtinction not lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the worſhip called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which they avowedly ſay, ſhould be given to images, Saints, &amp;c. And this they father on <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> But theſe two words are promiſcuouſly taken in Scripture, and both of them given to GOD, as ſhal be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its proper place.

When <hi>Iohn the divine</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, doth he not forbid him, <hi>Rev:</hi> 22. 9. and ſay <hi>worſhip GOD?</hi> Belike he knew not this diſtinction. <hi>Is</hi> it not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>will worſhip, Col</hi> 2. 23. Then it is not <gap reason="foreign">

This diſtinction then is groundleſs. Is it not lamentable that men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb facs="tcp:60150:11"/>
Chriſtianitie, ſhould ſo hazard upon Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, Superſtition and will worſhip, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful diſtinction, which can neither ſatisfie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor conſcience? And dare any tender Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian think that ſuch jugling work will be his peace in the day of diſtreſs and death? What is this but a lie in the right hand? Therefore let all who love and fear the Lord bewarre of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which ſtandeth on ſuch cogling diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their great refuge when they cannot mantain theſe abſurdities, is, that we calumniat them, &amp; miſtate queſtions. And if neither of theſe can ſerve, then they alleadge, that theſe are the opinions of ſome privat Doctors, and not the judgement of their Church. But in this vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, let all be aſſured, that to my beſt uptaking, nothing is fathered on this Adverſary but what he ſaith directly, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequentially, nothing brought againſt him but that which is either literally, or interpretatively in the written word of GOD, or human Authours. Albeit it he notoriouſly known that Papiſts uphold their tottering <hi>Babel</hi> by lies, murthers, treaſons, deluding wonders, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, mutilating, foiſting, embezeling diverſe teſtimonies divine and huma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, as ſhal be made out hereafter, yet we have not ſo learned Chriſt. The truths of Chriſts Goſpel need not ſuch proppes, and we are not allowed to lie for GOD. It is a meer evaſion to caſt over what they cannot make good on their privat Doctours. For the
<pb facs="tcp:60150:11"/>
decrees of the council of <hi>Trent</hi> to which now they profeſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, are purpoſly contrived in many particulars, like the <hi>Delphian oracles,</hi> and when they lurke under ambiguities, what way ſhall they be found out but by their Doctours, who are the expoſitors of their tenets<hi>:</hi> Beſide there be few or none of them cited, whoſe books are not approven, by Cenſurers appointed for that effect, the tenour of whoſe teſtimonie is, that ſuch books contain nothing contrar to the Catholick faith of the Church of Rome.

For the weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by which the Papiſts wage warre with the Scriptures, and the Reformed Church built thereon, are the ſame which <hi>Celſus</hi> uſed of old againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf, which <hi>Origen</hi> refuteth at length, he impeached the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and quarrelled the Chriſtians for their rents, for the calumnies of the world, &amp;c. If theſe have beat thee from the Reformed Religion, haſt thou not to fear, that they may ſhake thee in all, and turn thee at laſt Nulliſidian? As they make uſe of Pagan arguments, ſo of the Jewiſh, for they reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned juſt ſo againſt Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles. By what authority? where is your viſible ſucceſſion? have any of the rulers, Scribes or Phariſees beleeved on him? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It hath pleaſed the Lord to furniſh us with good defences, but it is ſtrange, that they draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of their ſhafts from Pagan, and Jewiſh Antichriſtian quivers, ſhould not be aſhamed of their way. And it is more ſtrange, that knowing men if conſcientions, ſhould be enſnared by them. It is known to ſuch as are not ignorant of Church hiſtory, that when Chriſtianity came firſt into this Yſle, they had nothing to do with Rome, for a long time they were ſtrangers and adverſaries to her ſoveraignty, and would not exchange the dyet of Eaſter for her

And when one <hi>Laurentius</hi> his ſucceſſor endeavoured the ſame, and thought the Scots would be more tractable, he found the plaine contrare: as he writteth to the Abbates in Scotland, for <hi>Dagamus</hi> the Scotiſh Biſhop, who came to ſpeak with them, refuſed to eat or drink with <hi>Laurentius,</hi> or ſtay in the roome where he was. So little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion would they here have then with Romaniſts. Now that Church is farre more corrupt, then it was in <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes, and ours more pure and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened then it was at that time. What phreneſie muſt it be therefore in them now who are members of this Church, to enter into communion with Romaniſts, or tamper with, or haunker after their way. Let all who love the Truth ſtand in awe thus to ſin, we have a ſafer ſurer way for Salvation nor Popery, wherein if we walk, peace and mercy ſhal be on us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
            <p>Leaſt this Preface ſwell diſproportionably, I will offer four advyees to my Countrey-men, that they may be perſwaded from Poperie; and then cloſe with a word more particularly to the Inhabitants of this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If ye would guard well againſt Popery, have
<pb facs="tcp:60150:15"/>
a full perſwaſion of the Truth, from the ground of divine revelation, in the holy Scriptures. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. 14. <hi>Hold fast the forme of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, that good thing which is commited to thee, keep by the holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in us.</hi> For men not perſwaded by divine faith, like to young ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, evil grounded in their principles are eaſily put from their grounds, and toſſed to and froe with every wind of doctrine: <hi>Perſuaſiſti mihi Domine</hi> ſaith <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>confeſ. cap.</hi> 5. this keeped him faſt. When once divine Truth ſinketh into the heart, ye will have a ſincere love to it for it ſelf, and not for any by reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects or worldly advantages. Otherwayes when truth florteth only in the head, and men are bated with worldly temptations, and ſelfiſh intereſts, they are ſoon drawn away from the truth, which in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is poſtponed to that which they love better. And GOD in his holy juſtice giveth them up to ſtronge deluſions for their hypocriſie, and want of ſinceritie, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. 11. the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſpirit to them who ask him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. If ye love the truth, ſeek the grace and ſtrength of the holy Spirit to lead you into all truth, and labour to grow in grace, and the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, following diligently the means appointed thereto by GOD himſelf, to wit, reading, hearing the Word preached, receiving the holy Sacrament of the Supper, as GOD ſhal give opportunitie, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, prayer, ſpiritual conference, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60150:16"/>
2. <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 17. Beware of looſeneſs and all prophanneſs in converſation, for it is righteouſneſs with GOD to puniſh practical Atheiſts, by giving them over to ſpeculative Atheiſme, whereby they are hardened in their wicked courſes; And ſilly women led away with diverſe luſtes are eaſie led captive, and detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in errour by ſeducers, whoſe doctrine hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with their looſe way of living, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Bewarre of prejudice againſt reformed Miniſters or Proſeſſours, where this entereth it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the evil eye, and if the eye be evil, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dark, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 23. Some alleadge that the pupil of a Witch eye is inverted by malice. Certainly the underſtanding of any man is in hazard to be thus perverted. That which made <hi>Porphyre, Iulian,</hi> and other Apoſtats fall away from the truth, was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>prejudice and paſsion.</hi> It is reported of an <hi>Indian,</hi> that being wronged by the <hi>Spainard,</hi> when ſome were inſtructing him about Chriſtianity, and the way to Heaven, he refuſed to be a Chriſtian, becauſe he heard that the <hi>King of Spain</hi> was walking in that path; in this he was Pagan like. Let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be aſhamed to ſpeak or do ſo. If men in this controverſal age, have done or ſuffered injuries, for the Lords ſake let none of theſe things make you wronge the truth of GOD, your own conſciences, or the Mother Church, which did bear or foſter you. Alace, what evil hath the Goſpel of Chriſt done to you? Wherein hath it weatied you, whoſe Oxe or Aſs hath it taken, teſtifie againſt it if ye dare? Why
<pb facs="tcp:60150:16"/>
then will ye wronge the Maſter for the Servants ſake, and hate the truth, becauſe ye love not ſome who profeſs to adbere to it? Is it imaginable that ſuch back-ſliding courſes will afford you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the end of the day, when the ſilver corde is looſed, and the pitcher broken at the well? Were it a good defence for treaſon, to ſay to a King, <hi>ſome fellow ſubjects have wronged me.</hi> How eaſily might he return this, <hi>ſhal ye therefore wrong my law? It may be your wronge is ſuppoſed not real, and admit it be ſo indeed, two blacks makes not one white, ye ſhould remember the oath of alleag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Was this the way to right your wronges, whereunto was ye baptized; Why gadde ye abroad to change your way?</hi> This is baſeneſs belovv a Chriſtian or any man of honour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let all lovers of truth love one another dearly, and entertaine the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; This is a ſence againſt foes, forbear and forgive one another, let the ſtronge bear with the weak, and if in all things ye cannot be like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (which is rather to be w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctioned. <hi>And whereunto ye have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained walk by the ſame rule, and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, the Lord will reveal that in due time, and teach you that which ye ſee not.</hi> When breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are amongſt ſincere Chriſtians, who fear the Lord and his goodneſs, the adverſarie who waiteth for their halting, caſteth oyle on the flame, and with
<pb facs="tcp:60150:17"/>
jeering warmeth his hands at the fire. All the wilde beaſts of the wilderneſs, enter in at thoſe breaches, and are readie to take away the wine-preſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with open mouth the tender Vines. <hi>Joſephus de Bello Judaico,</hi> telleth us, that the <hi>Romans</hi> of old over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> eaſily, becauſe the chief Captaines within the walls fought eagerly amongſt themſeves, and were ſo divided by the wrath of GOD, that their animoſitie was greater againſt other, nor the common adverſarie; this prepared the way for their ſudden overthrow. And when the Roman Eagles did ſlee to BRITTAIN, the Hiſtorian <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how they in this Iſle were vanquiſhed, <hi>dum ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli pugnant univerſi vincuntur.</hi> Little was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to the adverſaries hand. So the new Romaniſts take the ſame advantage againſt our <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> therfore we ſhould be the more diligent to endeavour by all Chriſtian wayes, that peace may be within her wals, and proſperity within her palaces. It would be well adverted that the enemie is at the gates, therefore ſhould be watchfully eyed in all our deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Every time hath its own tryal and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the diſpenſation of this ſinful time calleth for much conſideration; and they who underſtand the language of it, may excel amongſt their brethren, and ſerve the generation beſt in the fear of the Lord. The Chriſtians in <hi>Perſia</hi> ſaith <hi>Theod lib.</hi> 5. <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:60150:17"/>
               <hi>Askelon.</hi> It was ſaid of old amongſt Pagans, behold the Chriſtians how they love one another, and their adverſaries were forced to commend them, for ſweet harm: leſs carriage. This is an ornament to profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a guarde to the truths of the Goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ye tender the honour of the Lord, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his truth, live in love; love the truth and peace, follow peace and holineſs, this will at leaſt damp adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Labour to know experimentally the power of Chriſtian Religion, nothing will more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly refute Poperie to you, nor the kingdom of grace in power. Poperie is a humane device, full of pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhadows, which hath no concord with the light and life of the Goſpel. For the more ſhadow the leſs light. The Northern-people from whom the Sun is remore, are circled with ſhadows<hi>:</hi> but theſe who have the Sun perpendicularly over them, and are under it at the Noone-tyde, have little or no ſhadow. So, if ye would decline the Popiſh groves, live near the Sun of righteouſneſs. The Popiſh traſh cannot pleaſe a reformed Chriſtian. Holy <hi>Augustin ep.</hi> 119. complaineth that in his time the Church was preſſed, contrar to the merciful inſtitution of Chriſt, with ſuch a ſervile burthen of ceremonies, that the ſtate of the Jews under the Law, was more tolerable nor the condition of Chriſtians. ſeeing they were ſubject to the ordinances of GOD, and not to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane preſumptions. If he had now lived and ſeen their gadie way, what would he have ſaid? Surely
<pb facs="tcp:60150:18"/>
this, that the Romiſh Church is full of ſhadows, therfore, far from the Sun. The beſt refutation of ſome points of Arminianiſme, is the power and efficacie of Goſpel grace on the heart. Will ever that man be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve Free-will in its extent, as it is taught by them, to whom the Lord hath ſpoken with an high hand, and determined for his dutie? No verily! Or will any of the Circumciſion who worſhip GOD in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and put no confidence in the fleſh; Be delighted with a burdenſom bounde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of humane inventions, or place worſhip in theſe? It cannot be, ſuch will conſider <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. and ſo acocunt that worſhip vain. The Merchants have not alwayes the beſt ſhops who hang forth pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſigns. Nor is ſhe reputed a chaſte woman who is fearded in the face, and cloathed with the attire of an harlot. The whoriſh garbe of <hi>Rome,</hi> will not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctily pleaſe ſouls eſpouſed to that one Husband <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> therefore live like the Goſpel. And if ye be ſealed by it to the day of Redemption, with the holy Spirit of promiſe, the Scripture truths will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to you. That which rendreth many unſtable is a notional <hi>Carteſian</hi> way of Religion; but ſincere Chriſtians have not ſo learned Chriſt. If thou once taſte how good the Lord is, and if he hath given thee ſongs in the night, his teſtimonies to thee will be more then thy neceſſarie food. Irreligious prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Popery are practically ſo ſibb to other, that the one uſhereth in the other. Nothing maketh me fear the growth of this bitter root in the Land more,
<pb facs="tcp:60150:18"/>
then the deludge of prophanneſs, which overfloweth all the banks. When men belie their Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>being abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobat.</hi> Is it not to be feared, that the Lord make ſuch like <hi>Shiloh, Ier.</hi> 7. 17. live then holily and righteouſly. <hi>If ye do his will ye ſhal know the doctrine whither it be of GOD or not, Iohn</hi> 7. 17. Godlineſs hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come; it is nor much to be feared that many (if any) who have taſted of the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the ordinances of the Reformed Church, will turne away to Popery; That ſeal on the heart will prove a notable preſervative.</p>
            <p>I ſhal conclude this Preface with a word of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to the Inhabitants of <hi>Dundee,</hi> whom I dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, and have in my heart frequently before the Lord. That ſeeing the Lord hath made you one of the conſiderable incorporations in this Nation, ye would conſecrate your gaine to him, by proving va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for his truth on earth, it is not unknown how the Lord honoured this place, by making an early profer of the Goſpel to it, by that faithful Servant and Martyr of Chriſt, <hi>Mr. George Wiſhart</hi> who preached the Goſpell here, and edified many by his powerfull preaching. One <hi>Robert Milne</hi> who had then ſway in the Tovvn, to pleaſe that <hi>Cardinal Beton,</hi> by vvhom he vvas corrupted and byaſſed with bribes, as our Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtorians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell, diſcharged the faithful ſervant of Chriſt, from preaching in the Tovvn any more, to vvhom he replyed, <hi>I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60150:19"/>
               <hi>but if it be long well with you I am not led by the ſpirit of Truth: and if unexpected trouble fall on you, remember this is the cauſe of it; Turne then to God by repentance, for he is mercifull.</hi> This vvord was verified, for within four days after his departur, the plague of peſtilence break up here. Then ſent they for him as ſick men do for a Phiſitian, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning comforted the unthankful people vvho ſhut him out; Preached on the Eaſt-port, on that text <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107. v. 20. <hi>he ſent his word and healed them,</hi> ſhortly thereafter the plague ceaſed. The Word of GOD backed by prophecie, and providence did take ſo deep impreſſion on the people, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eminent promoters of the vvork of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for ought that I can learn from that time or thereabout Poperie decayed ſo in this place, that none avouched it till the year 1662. then ſome three or four did break out to the great ſcandal of the Congregation.

Now Reader, ſtay and impartially conſider the weaknes and impertinency of theſe 5 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why our faith ſhould not be reſolved into the Scriptures and determined by them. For the ſume of all is thus concluded. The word of GOD is not wel underſtood by ſome, is evil tranſlated by others, and Hereticks and Schiſmaticks have abuſed it: therefore, we ſhould not make uſe of it as the rule of faith and manners.

And the judgement of a pure Church in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious caſes, ſhould weigh much with privat Chriſtians.

               <hi>well, and it confirmeth all I have ſaid, but refuteth your former anſwer to the full. For if the unlearned as well as the unſtable wreſt the ſcripture to their own deſtruction, then Scripture can neither be the determiner of faith nor the judge of controverſies to them, and ſo they muſt have another, both to inſtruct the ignorant and ſettle the unſtable; as we muſt all have ſome infallible judge to know who wreſt the Scripture who not: otherwiſe we may well agree in the letter, but we will never</hi>

But you ſay, <hi>it refuteth what was ſaid formerly.</hi> This cannot be made good, for ſtill I ſaid it was the rule of faith, to right diſcerners, and ſometime you grant this, as in the latter part of your <hi>fifth Reaſon,</hi> whereby indeed you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all you have ſaid, and yeelds the cauſe fully. Now what contradiction can be here? <hi>The ſcripture is the rule to all right diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and as many as walk according to this rule peace ſhal be on them: but men who wreſt the word, unlearned, unſtable ſoules, fall into perdi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it not a ſtrange conſequence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thence, that theſe unlearned, unſtable ſoules ſhould have another rule and another judge? In the 19. of <hi>Luke</hi> v. 27. it is ſaid by our Lord, that his enemies who would not have him to reign over them, ſhould be brought forth and ſlain before him: will it therefore follow, that he ſhould not reign over them?

And ſaith, that the Church ſhould judge the true ſenſe of Scripture, yet tell us not what they mean by the Church. Now, whatever way it be taken, whither for Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there muſt be another judge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, otherwiſe the Church wanted a judge 300 years, for there was no ſuch judge then pretending to the infallible ſupremacie now claimed. Secondly, The Romiſh Synagogue headed by the Pope cannot be our judge, for they are party partial againſt whom we have juſt acception. Thirdly, Is not this a jugling
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60150:48"/>
trick, that when controverſies occaſioned and raiſed by them, are in the Chriſtian Church, they will have none to be judge but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo they would be ſure of the ſentence, and muſt ſuſpect their own cauſe. Fourthly, If by the Church they mean the Pope, as now they mantain, it is hard to call him judge of controverſies, ſeeing it is a great controverſie whither there ſhould be any Pope at all, and beyond controverſie with us that he is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper. Fifthly, According to the Popiſh tenet, the intention of the Prieſt is neceſſar in his ordination, in his Baptiſm; ſucceſſion without interruption is neceſſar; and Simony maketh him no Pope, as <hi>Gratian</hi> telleth from the Canon law, <hi>cauſa</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. Now if ſo, he may be a Pagan, for who knoweth the Prieſts intention who baptized him? He may be a Laick, and yet without ordination upon the ſame ground; if one be ſuch, it marreth uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and ſo ceaſeth the Pope. Then by your own writters it is clear, that many Popes entered by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as <hi>Barronius</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Annal: tom.</hi> 9. <hi>ad annum. Chriſti.</hi> 912. And <hi>Alexander the</hi> 6. was notorious that way. This un Popeth all, for it breaketh the chain of ſucceſſion, and leaveth the Church collective without any judge. It is clear hence, how ſlipperie the Romiſh Church is in its foundations: ſeeing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60150:49"/>
he whom they call the Church may be a Pagan <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the ſecond thing propoſed, viz. Whither Church officers ſince the days of the Apoſtles are infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Church whither taken for Pope or Council, or Pope &amp; Council is not infallible. When the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils condemned hereticks of old, they did it not <hi>pro arbitratu &amp; imperio:</hi> but judged by the Scriptures which is indeed an infallible rule, but the church taken whither for Pope or Council, or Pope and Council is not infallible. Firſt, If the Jewiſh-church erred in matter of faith and worſhip, then may the chriſtian-church erre alſo. For they had ſtatutes, judgements, and promiſes<hi>:</hi> to them were committed the oracles of GOD. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. But <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people erred groſly, <hi>Ex</hi> 32. So did <hi>Uriah</hi> the Prieſt, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16. May not then Popes erre? Seeing <hi>Aaron</hi> the ſaint of the Lord was not infallible.

Secondly, Under the Goſpel Popes and Councils have erred, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not infallible. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>contra Praxetam,</hi> that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Pope approved <hi>Montanus</hi> hereſie, and obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <hi>ones, and it were better to be much in fasting and prayer for direction, then to bragge we cannot erre.</hi> So then I reaſon, the Pope may erre, Councils may erre, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope and Council may erre. The argument will hold here, <hi>a diviſis ad conjugata.</hi> as well as thus, the Magiſtrat may be diſeaſed, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil infected, therefore both Magiſtrat and Council are ſubject to ſickneſs. It is a delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evaſion, to ſay, that the Councils confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Pope cannot erre, for the Jeſuits place the infallibility in the Pope, the <hi>Parl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> in the Council, and they are not agreed in this amongſt themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the ſenſe of the one, a Church Seſſion confirmed by the Pope is as infallible as a Council. And in the ſenſe of the other, a Council confirmed by a privat Biſhop is at infallible as if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope. Thus then we argue, that muſt have no entity which can find no ſubject, but Papiſts cannot agree upon the ſubject of this infallibility, therefore it is not <hi>ens.</hi> Further, General Councils have been of this judgement, that the Popes conſent is not requiſit for making their decrees right. For in the <hi>Council of Chalcedon</hi> where were conveened 630. fathers in the year 454. where <hi>Martianus</hi> the Emperour was preſent, it was contrar to the deſire of the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, appointed, that ſeeing the ſeat of <hi>Rome</hi>

the inward teſtimony of the holy Spirit is the principle effective of divine faith, and the Scriptures themſelves are the formal reaſon and terminative principle, whereinto divine faith is reſolved, as a building upon its foundation. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.

Eccl. pol. Sect. 14. pag. 36. <hi>of theſe things neceſſar ſaith he, the very chief is to know what books we eſteem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is impoſſible for it ſelf to teach. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to your only determiner of faith, in your firſt anſwer. And truely I think this ſhould be the firſt question of all, to the pure reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the pure word of God, as you cal them, which are the books of the pure word of GOD? Now if you anſwer, theſe are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by all which you make the rule of faith, how few books of Scripture ſhal be this rule, if any at all? For there be few or none whereof ſome have not doubted or flatly denyed.</hi> Saint Auguſtin contra Fauſtum Manichaeum, <hi>and</hi> lib. de mor.

               <hi>Jews did deny the New Testament? What books of Scripture are mantained by all? For by that, you make the conſent of all judge of canonical Scripture, how then can you diſclaim tradition, and ſay immediatly after men are mutable creatures, and at their beſt state va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Seeing upon the conſent of men ye take up your rule of faith, and number of Scripture books. I know other</hi> Proteſtants <hi>alleadge for this, that the books of Scripture like the Sun ſhew themſelves to be ſuch, to him who hath the ſpirit. But I would ask at ſuch, why the</hi> Rev.

And here I remarke that</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Ministers and preachers deceive the people, in that they ground their faith on the written word only, and Roman Catholicks ſay they on humane tradition, and their Churches authority, which being compoſed of men is ſubject to errour. Whereas the contrar is true, for Roman Catholicks believe nothing which the written word (believing both the tradition of the Church and Apoſtles) doth not expreſly warrand. As for the Church, what is more expreſly ſaid then what I have cited, both to prove that we are bound to hear her,</hi> Mat. 18. 18. <hi>and hold her authority infallible.</hi> Math. 16. 18: <hi>and the houſe of God which is the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 15. <hi>Neither doth it avail you to ſay, this is not ſaid of the Roman Church, which is not the univerſal Church, but a particular one a ſtrumpet, &amp;c. For we ſpeak not of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, when we ſay that the Church</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60150:58"/>
               <hi>is infallible, nor when we ſay the Roman, the Catholick, do we underſtand the particular Church, at Rome? But that Church which profeſſeth constantly the Romans faith, ſpread in ſaint</hi> Pauls <hi>time through all the world. As we call yet the Roman Empire that which hath its ſeat in Vien of Austria. Yea,</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>calling their own the reformed Church, cannot ſay but we have one Church on earth, which Chriſt commanded us to hear conſtantly. And if the reformed Church be the true Church, then ſhe muſt have taken the place from that church which was deformed, and had fallen into an errour, and ſo deſerved no more to be called the pillar and ground of truth, or to be heard. Moreover, the very pillars of the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion, grant all the world to be in an errour before themſelves, and ſo againſt the expreſs written Word muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the infallibility of any Church whatever. For</hi> Calv.

               <hi>bound by oath to the Pope; which if it be true that the Church in former ages did erre, the reformed Church may erre, that themſelves do not deny. Thence it followeth clearly, that the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Church is not the houſe of GOD called the pillar and ground of truth, that ſhe is not Chriſts Church, againſt which the gates of hell ſhal not prevail, that none are bound to hear her in matters of faith, being ſubject to errour. And ſo</hi> Proteſtants <hi>may well deſire men to read the Scripture and believe what they found there, but not urge any man to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their doctrine, but in ſo far as they find it conforme to Scripture, which all Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks proteſt they do not.

To this I anſwere, that the firſt Text, is meaned of the collective body of the Church, which fall not away; this is clear from the context, for it is the Church builded on that confeſſion mentioned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles<hi>:</hi> and an houſe ſo builded cannot fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is builded on a rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 25. Yet it will not follow that there be no drops in it; for particular beleevers cannot totally and finally fall away, but that they are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible who can ſay? ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 28. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yare it with 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, your own writters interpret it ſo, ſee <hi>Melchior Canus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de loc.

            <p>The ſecond Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a particular Church, which you grant is not infallible, ſo <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> interpreteth the place, and it is further clear from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, for it is the Church, to which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals ſhould be made <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> this undoubtedly is a particular Church. But admitting that it is meaned of the univerſal church, your Pope nor your Church is not it.</p>
            <p>The third Text 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. holdeth forth no more then what is granted in the anſwer to the fourth queſtion, or if you pleaſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60150:64"/>
to take learned <hi>Cameron</hi> his expoſition, who knitteth theſe words with the 16. verſe, you may do well. But what ever be the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the true Goſpel Church, which is the Bride of Jeſus Chriſt, Rome hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted all theſe, and is but a leprous part of the univerſal Church, you grant that the church of Rome is but a particular church. Why plead you then for the whole privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the univerſal Church? Is not this abſurd arrogance? Nor doth <hi>Calvin, Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Luther</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> ſpeak abſolutly as ye alleadge, but aſſert that the generality for a time was leavened by Popery which is truth. But what then followeth? That the myſterie of iniquity did ariſe by degrees and over-runne all for the moſt we grant, ſo did the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie; therefore was not <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſius,</hi> and ſuch as adbered to the truth, right in their way? The whole world in the Apoſtles time did ly in wickedneſs, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 19. Therefore were they not Sons of truth who endeavoured a Goſpel reformation. Your laſt hold is tradition, and you ſay, we are commanded to hold them. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. for this you cite <hi>Aug. Cyprian, St. Dennis, Epiphanius.</hi> To this I anſwer, we are not againſt Apoſtolick traditions, nor Church hiſtory in matters of fact, We make uſe of traditions there mentioned: But for your
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60150:65"/>
Legends, we deny that they are ſuch and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them. Have you Sir learned Logick? Why do you argument ſo, <hi>a genere ad ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem affirmative?</hi> Is this a good argument, <hi>Eſt annual, ergo eſt homo, he is a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore he is a man?</hi> Can this be better, <hi>there were traditions delivered to the Church of Theſſalonica, ergo, yours are theſe. Credat Judaeus Appella?</hi> Secondly, If there were unwritten traditions, why do you dare to writ theſe things which the Apoſtles would not writ? Thirdly, Will that argue the Scripture of imperfection? You may as well argue, the Miniſter writteth a book the ſumme of which he hath preached to people, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his book is imperfect. You have then to prove for your end, that theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions mentioned, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15. were about matters of faith. Secondly, If ſo they be no where written in Scripture. Thirdly, That if they be not written, they be the ſame which ye deliver to the people, and by what authority ye preſs and writ them. But to take this text wholly from your miſ-interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hear <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>that the Apoſtle ſpake not of diverſe doctrines, but of the ſame diverſely delivered.</hi> For firſt he preached to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and then did writ the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. But as where ever ye find fire in the Scripture ye make it Purgatory, ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60150:65"/>
where ye find tradition, ye make it <hi>pari ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> yours<hi>:</hi> Will ye liſten to <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verbo Dei cap.</hi> 10. and he will put all out of doubt, for he granteth that all in ſubſtance were written by the Apoſtles, which they preached to the people, or were neceſſar to ſalvation, <hi>Cyprian in his epiſt. ad Pompeium,</hi> admitteth not any traditions, but ſuch as may be perceived to be in the Evangels, in the Epiſtles or Acts of the holy Apoſtles. Therefore it is a perfect rule to all diſcerners ſay I, and no more was at firſt aſſerted. Your Maxime <hi>Idem est non eſſe &amp; non apparere,</hi> holdeth in law but not in divinity. For the ſoul is not viſible yet who can deny the being of it. What is more in the Reply I judge not worthy the noticeing, and I am forced to make digreſſion, becauſe of an impertinent return. Is it not ſtrange, that when I called men mutable creatures, and at their beſt ſtate vanitie, ſubject to claſhing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and that the written Word is the only infallible rule for direction: that upon this tradition, univerſal conſent, ſhould be ſo prolixely commented on without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. They who follow this reflecter muſt reſolve to deviat from tho high way.</p>

Secondly, In all ages there have been and are, eminent profeſſours of that doctrine which we mantaine, as is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved by <hi>Flaccus Illyricus</hi> in his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, Teſtium veritatis,</hi> and learned <hi>Dr. Uſher in ſucceſſione Eccleſiae reform:</hi> which teſtimonies no Popiſh ſhaveling of what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordour, yet could anſwer. Thirdly, where was the church of Rome as now conſtituted, before the council of Trent? Nay more, was the Popes ſupremacy and infallibility heard of the 600 year after Chriſt? Is not all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith as ſuch reſolved into a lie, viz. the infallibility of the Pope or Council, which though errand untruths are the key of the Popiſh Religion. Fourthly, All the poſitives of the reformed Religion, were mantained ſubſtantially in the Primitive church, the firſt 300. years, (I ſpeake not of changeable circumſtances, nor integrals, but eſſentials) and the negatives could not be there, becauſe the controverſies were not then ſtarted. But ye Papiſts have amaſſed a body of humane

inventions, &amp; groſs errours contrare to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, obtruding them under <hi>Anathema,</hi> to be the eſtabliſhed doctrine of the Church. And becauſe we of the reformed Profeſſion will not own theſe, and call that which is new old, ye excommunicat us as Hereticks.</p>

               <hi>your doctrine is as old as ſcripture, and your Church as the Apostles; and this is common to you with all ſectaries to claime the ſcripture and the Church, in the time of the Apoſtles. And like to that anſwer of the common people, we are all come of</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve. <hi>But I ſhall let you preſently ſee, how contrar your doctrine is to that ſcripture, and how unlike your Church is to that of the Apoſtles the firſt</hi> 300 <hi>year. In the ſecond part ye pretend that</hi> Illyricus <hi>and</hi> Doctor Uſher <hi>have ſufficiently ſhewed that there have been eminent men of your Profeſſion in all ages, and that without a Reply of any Popiſh ſhaveling of whatever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. But Sir, I am ſorrie that you who are a Nazarian and not a ſhaveling, ſhoule be ſo ill verſed in books of controverſie, as not to have ſeen ſo many Catholick writters who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat clearly, that of all theſe eminent men before</hi> Calvin <hi>you pretend to be yours, there is not one, hath holden all the ſame tenets with you and no more.

And as for the Fathers, hear if they were yours in the opinion of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> Proteſtants. Dudithius apud Bezam, ep. 1.

Your own <hi>Rainerius</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, giveth this verdict concerning us, that we are ſaid to have been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and walked by the Scriptures.

Thirdly, That which I ſaid I will mak good, that all the poſitive fundamentals of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were mantained in the Church the firſt 400. years. This appeareth from the <hi>Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions of Faith</hi> then made, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Let any read the <hi>Apoſtolick, Nicaene,</hi> or <hi>Anathaſius Creed,</hi> the determinations of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> council written by <hi>Cyril of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> made by the council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and there they will find exact conformity with the poſitives of our Religion. Popery addeth to theſe their own inventions, which we renounce, and this maketh the difference. To make this truth appear the more, I ſhal name theſe foundations. The doctrine of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> upon which our faith is build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We hold that there is one GOD, &amp; three Perſons, that the world was made by GOD; and man the tennant, when the houſe was made, appointed to bring in his rent. That man was made according to the Image of GOD, in holineſs, and righteouſneſs. That he fell from his firſt ſtate, and turned to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60150:72"/>
creature by tranſgreſſion. That ſin entered this, and death by ſin. That he ſinned as a publick perſon, and involved poſteritie under a curſe. That GOD ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry GOD, made fleſh in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin: and dyed for our ſins, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter burial, roſe again for our righteouſne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You bring the four Councils for the Popes univerſal ſupremacie and infallibility. If this be not it which you intend to prove, your anſwer meereth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60150:77"/>
and by providence contradict your ſelf, it is known that in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> no mention is made of an univerſal, far leſs infallible Pope. You cite the 29. Canon of the <hi>Nicaen</hi> Council, whereas there were but 22. of them in whole, ſaith <hi>Ruffinus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Their ſixth Canon is far from that.

Why then ſay you that he was eſtabliſhed there univerſal infallible Mona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then no univerſal head, theſe two ſeem to claſh, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil wordeth it better. But why do you not mention his infallibility in your Reply; It is the koy of Popery, and let you it thus ſlip out amongſt your hands? Not one Father or primitive Council is cited for this. The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſaith expreſly, that the Pope of Rome hath no priviledge from

Further, the worſhipping of God by Images, is expreſly forbidden in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command, as the worſhiping of a falſe God, is in the firſt.

            <p>Idolatrie, is to be defined here by uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted writters, for if <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines ſhould only define the caſe, partiality might be alledged, as if we made a definition, to inferre our own concluſion. Therefore to ſtopp the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

exception. Idolatrie <hi>is religious worſhip, tendered to that which is not GOD.</hi> It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>religious</hi> worſhip, for it is not <hi>civil,</hi> relating to the fifth Command which is here handled. But that which is comprized in the firſt and ſecond, conſiſting in adoration, truſting, prayer, vowes, worſhip, ſwearing, dedication of Temples and dayes. When men give that to Images, Saints, Croſſes, Reliques, which is due to GOD, that is idolatry, by the mouth of the ſpirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture, <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them to ſerve them.

                  </gap>e that truſteth in them.</hi> Now then, ſervice, bowing, truſting in, or to images is Idolatry, curſed and confounded by the word of GOD. Secordly, Ancients deſine it thus, <hi>Idolatrie is that Quae DEO fraudem ſacit, honorem debitum, DEO denegans, &amp; conferens aliis.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Tertullian lib. de idololatria,</hi> that is Idolatrie, which p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>loineth honour from the Lord, and giveth it to others beſide him, as adultery giveth conjugal benevolence to others, beſide the husband or wife. <hi>Idolum</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſiodorus in ſuis Origin: lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Est ſimulachrum, quod humana effigie factum</hi>

So the exhibition of Religious worſhip to that is Idolatrie, according to him. <hi>Aug. epist.</hi> 119. <hi>ad Jan.</hi> ſaith, <hi>in primo praecepto prohibetur coli aliqua in ſigmentis hominum DEI ſimilitudo, quia nulla imago ejus coli debet niſi illa quae hoc eſt quod ipſe, nec pro illo aut cum illo.</hi> In the firſt Command (where he taketh in the ſecond) to us every ſimilitude of GOD is forbidden to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, becauſe nothing ſhould be wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhiped with him, or for him, but He himſelf alone. Then according to him, worſhip given to any Image made with hands not being God is Idolatrie. Then it will follow, firſt, that the Gentiles did not alwayes worſhip a falſe GOD, as ye ſhal afterwards hear. And next, that the Images repreſenting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he true God, worſhiped by them were Idols. So that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt be Idolatrie w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erever it is. The Adulterie of a Pagan and a Chriſtian are one.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60150:94"/>
the temple of God, and declaimeth againſt <hi>Pilat</hi> for intending the like. It is known, how averſe the Jewes after the captivitie were, from this way, whatever pollutions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they committed. Religious worſhip, rendered to Images, was deteſted by them, and reckoned Idolatrous. <hi>Varro</hi> a heathen, as he is cited by <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de civit: Dei,</hi> ſayeth, that at Rome in the beginning, <hi>fuit purior Dei cultus, ſine ſimulachris, centum ſeptuaginta annis.</hi> Then by the twilight of Pagans, the worſhip is polluted, which is by Images. And in Pagan Rome, it was free of that 170. years. Afterwards they took in Images, and multiplyed their Gods, ſo were they given up as the Apoſtle telleth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. By all theſe it is evident that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie is religious worſhip, given to that which is not GOD.</p>
            <p>Idolatry, Superſtition, and Will-worſhip, may be thus diſtinguiſhed. <hi>Superſtition</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Etymolygie of the word, <hi>ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> and may be in many caſes where there be no worſhip at all. As when men are afraid of the ſigns in Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 1. 2.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60150:95"/>
which ordinarily prophecieth according to their ſentiments, all the fears they imagine. The Papiſts would willingly take with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, if we make Scripture the ſole rule of faith and manners. In this they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſome Witches, who will acknowledge, when pannelled, groſs crims, ſuch as adultery drunkenneſs, ſwearing, Sabbath breaking, that they may be thought the more ingenuous in denying Witch-chraft. <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Imag. cap.</hi> 8. ſaith no leſs, <hi>Non eſt tam certum, an imagines DEI, &amp; ſanctae Trinitatis, ſint fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendae in Eccleſia?

            <p>The ſtate of the queſtion betwixt us and Romaniſts is this, whither they by their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip break the firſt and ſecond Command? and ſo are guilty of Idolatrie, this they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And we prove by theſe following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. first,</hi> Who ever do give religious worſhip to that which is not GOD, are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Idolatrie, but the Papiſts do ſo. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is the definition, already conſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus proved, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip religiouſly Saints, Angels, Croſſes, Reliques, Images, bow down to them, build Temples, make Proceſſions, light Tapers, which <hi>Hierom</hi> calleth <hi>inſignia Idololatriae,</hi> therfore they give to theſe religious worſhip. Beſide it is not civil worship, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, for there is no midle worſhip betwixt theſe two. Further the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the decree concerning Reliques, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth worſhip to them, <hi>opis impetrandae cauſa.</hi> Is not this to truſt in them for help? They give to Angels and Saints that which <hi>Peter</hi> refuſed from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> yet his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſucceſſour claimeth it thrice together; once at the door, the ſecond in the midle of the room, and the third when they kiſs his foot <note n="†" place="margin">See St. Amours Iournal.</note>. They give that to Angels which the

Angel inhibited <hi>Iohn</hi> twice to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 8. And ſay it was refuſed by the Angel out of modeſtie: whereas it is ſeriouſly forbidden with this reaſon, <hi>worſhip GOD,</hi> which is a ſufficient rule, directing us to give religious worſhip to none but GOD. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy GOD and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> The diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Roſaries,</hi> ſervice books, teſtify the contrar, which giveth them religious adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by prayer, praiſes, kiſſing, confidence. And will this ſatisfie a husband from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſs, that albeit ſhe committed unclean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs with another, yet it was not with that conjugal affection due to her husband. Now how can ſuch an evaſion then, ſatisfie the conſcience of a Papiſt, or ſuſtain before the Lord Jeſus who is the husband of his people? It is clear hence, that by ſo doing they break the firſt Command, and have other Gods beſide him, whom they make Omniſcient, Omnipreſent, in whom they truſt, from whom they ſeek aid and help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. ſecond,</hi> They who worſhip Images with religious worſhip, and break the ſecond Command, are guilty of Idolatrie, becauſe they worſhip the work of mens hands. But
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60150:97"/>
the Romaniſts do this, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> In anſwering this they do not agree amongſt themſelves, ſome of them deny the <hi>Major,</hi> as <hi>Vaſquez, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de ador. diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. for he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently averreth that <hi>Illa Moſaicae legis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio,</hi> meaning the ſecond Command, <hi>fuit juris poſitivi &amp; ceremonialis, quae tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Evangelii ceſſare debet,</hi> he calleth it a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial precept, which bindeth not us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. This is short work, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth the Law, becauſe he will not obey it. But why may not the firſt Command be declared ceremonial, upon the ſame ground, eſpeciallie by Papiſts, who make the ſecond a part of the firſt. And if ſo, Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm may be brought in by Romaniſts into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtorie, which many fear to be rankly rooted there. He who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to a graven Image,</hi> ſaid alſo with the ſame authority, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me, Et è contra.</hi> This man hath few followers. Therefore ſome deny the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as <hi>Durand, lib,</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 9. <hi>queſt.</hi> 2. who aſſerreth that they do not worſhip Images, but that which is repreſented by the Image.

They according to their manner, do not declare what manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be imparted. But it is ſure they mean not civil worſhip, therefore it muſt be religious. Thirdly, it is tendered to the Image it ſelf, <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> therefore the Image terminateth the worſhip, and is more then a memoriall.

               </gap>, and yet ſay they it is not Idolatrie, becauſe they worſhip not the timber or mettall, but the Image, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its forme or ſignification. And they worſhip not the Image of a falſe God, which they alleadge to be forbidden only in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command. So <hi>Aquinas part.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 25. <hi>Bonavent. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> But if this anſwer hold
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60150:98"/>
good, then the Pagans were not Idolaters; For they denyed that they did worship a ſtock or a ſtone. <hi>Aug. on Pſ.</hi> 114. bringeth in the Pagan anſwering thus, <hi>Non ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chruin colo, ſed ejus rei ſignum quam colere debet.</hi> And again, <hi>Non ſtipites colimus, ſed quae illis regendis praeſident numina.

Non illud colo quod video,</hi> i. e. <hi>the timber or ſtone, ſed ſervio ei quem non video. I ſerve him whom I ſee not.</hi> Secondly, They who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the brazen Serpent, did not worſhip the piece of braſs, but the forme of it. And they thought not that it had innate vertue, yet were guilty of Idolatrie. Thirdly, It is clear from ſcripture, that ſome of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, eſpecially at firſt, did worſhip by the Image the inviſible GOD who made all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. <hi>him whom ye ignorantly worſhip do I declare unto you.</hi> Yet were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>They changed the glory of the incorruptible GOD, into an Image made like man.</hi> It was the incorrubtile GOD his Image, and withall Idolatry. But fourthly, If only the Image of falſe Gods worſhipped, make Idolatrie, then Iſrael was not guilty of Idolatrie: But Iſrael was thus guilty, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> It is image-worſhip whither of the true or falſe Gods which is here forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60150:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For it is certain that the Golden-call was intended by them to repreſent the true GOD. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 5. <hi>To morrow is a feaſt to the Lord,</hi> and 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 33. 17. <hi>They ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fized in high places, yet to the Lord their God only.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel, Pſ.</hi> 106. 20.

For be confidently ſayeth, <hi>Now know I that the Lord will bleſs me, Judges</hi> 17. <hi>becauſe I have a Levit to be my Prieſt.</hi> They uſed not Levits, for the worſhip of falſe Gods. Further, the ſpeech of <hi>Stephen</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to prove it ſtrongly, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 40. 41. for ſpeaking of Iſraels worſhiping the Calf, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord for this gave them up to worſhip the hoſt of Heaven,</hi> Now when ſin is puniſhed by ſin, that ſin which is the judicial puniſhment, uſeth to be more groſs then the antecedent ſin, which is the procuring cauſe; but the worſhiping the hoſt of Heaven, is not ſo groſs as the worſhip of an Oxe: therefore they did worſhip GOD at firſt by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a Calf, yet were Idolaters. This anſwer then cannot ſatisfie the conſcience or reaſon of any man. And admit that the image of falſe Gods is forbidden in the ſecond Command, how dare Papiſts without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, and contrar to the word, make the Image of the true GOD, which he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12.

               <hi>Bellarmin de Imag.</hi> and <hi>Gregorius de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> diſtinguish the <hi>Minor</hi> another way, and reject the two former anſwers as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.

the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> ſay <hi>ſicut DEO,</hi> ſo to the Image.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Cultus religioſus est accidens hominis,</hi> if we ſpeak <hi>Phyſice,</hi> now gradual difference in theſe altereth not the kind of worſhip. Therefore, according to the rules of Logick, the worſhip is one with the worſhip of <hi>Thomiſts;</hi> or elſe they diſclaim a <hi>maxime,</hi> by making the one Idolatrie, the other not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We are forbidden to bow down to them, therefore the meaneſt degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip is forbidden in the ſecond Command. <hi>And they who break the leaſt Command, and teach men ſo, ſhal be least in the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 5. 19. Laſtly, the ſeduced people know nothing of this difference. Yea <hi>Bellarmin</hi> thinketh it not fit, that <hi>in concione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, for their Clergie men will not make it hold water.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some as <hi>Eckius</hi> in his <hi>Enchir:</hi> anſwers nothing but this to the argument, <hi>that it is the tradition of their Church, and Command of their Pope, which they judge themſelves obliedged to obey.</hi> If this anſwer be relevant then they were not faulty, <hi>who with their traditions, made the word of GOD of none effect, Matth.</hi> 15. 6. And Papiſts
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60150:100"/>

Centurie, no ſuch thing as image-worſhip was approved in the Chriſtian Church.

Further when <hi>Adrian</hi> did build a Temple for himſelf, the Pagans ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it was for the Chriſtians, becauſe it was <hi>ſine ſimulachris, without Images,</hi> whence it is clear, that the Image worſhip cometh nearer Paganiſm, then Primitive antiquity.

To which Queſtion, I anſwer with our Saviour in the Gospel, asking how a good tree can bring forth evil fruit: as</hi> David <hi>committing adulterie. For if you underſtood the one, you may eaſilie underſtand the other. Which if you do not go to the ſchool and learn the distinction betwixt</hi> ſimpliciter and ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, <hi>betwixt good and evil ſimplie and in part. For as there be few ſo good, but they do ſome evil: ſo there be few ſo bad, but they do ſome good, being aſſiſted by GODS actual grace, albeit they want ſanctifying grace. Yea, very good actions may be done with ſome little imperfection; which maketh the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our righteouſneſs to a menſtruous cloath.</hi>

for juſtification by faith without the workes of the law. My firſt argument was this. That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we are juſtified by faith without the workes of law,</hi> therefore not by them. You ſay, <hi>he meaneth not of workes of grace.</hi> What then? Of ſinful workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Coverſion? And is it indeed like, that ſinful workes can be called by the Apoſtle worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the law, ſeeing theſe are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the law? Or that the juſtitiaries amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, were ſo groſs as to aſſert, that ſinful workes juſtifie a man which condemn him. Secondly, you ſay, <hi>that juſtification by faith contradicteth ſcripture, James</hi> 2. 24. which place I explained and reconciled with the 4. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and all you ſay to that is, <hi>that I contradict my ſelf.</hi> I ſaid workes juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie faith, for my faith is known by my works to my ſelf and others. But that will nor ſay, that workes and faith juſtifie the man. So I claſh not with my ſelf here. And for your <hi>Maxime, cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi> If I underſtand this, you contradict your ſelf in the application of it; for faith being the cauſe of workes and juſtifying the man, workes are the effect of juſtificat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, not the cauſe of it. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhew me thy faith by thy workes, O man!</hi> For it cannot be ſhowen without workes. v. 18.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60150:116"/>
Albeit we ſay that faith alone juſtifieth, yet that <hi>Fides ſola in approhendendo, non eſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next argument was, that a man muſt be juſtified before he can work well, therefore workes are not the cauſe of juſtification. I hope you will not ſay, that the effect is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to its cauſe, if you have read <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Logick. And that a man muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before he can work well, I prove thus. He muſt be ſanctified, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a corrupt tret cannot bring forth good fruit, Matth.</hi> 7. 18. Ere you have not ſomething to ſay to this, you cloſe with <hi>Pelagius</hi> for a defence, and ſpeak non-ſenſe. For you ſay, <hi>that you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with our Saviour, by a diſtinction of that which is ſimply ſuch, and ſecundum quid.</hi> In what part of the Goſpel is this Logick to be found? For it is clear from the verſe above cited, that our Saviour denyeth ſimply the thing, ſo he granteth it not <hi>ſecundum quid. Some good acts you ſay, may be done by evil men, being aſſiſted by actual grace.</hi> I would know if actual grace can be in exerciſe, where habitual grace is not at all? then if men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually evil, in an unconverted ſtate, can do any thing well? That ſomething materially good may be done by them, as well as ſin may be committed by the regenerated, I doubt not: but that they can do ought upon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60150:116"/>
a good principle, for a good end, by a good morive, I deny it ſimply. Now if they be not ſuch they cannot juſtifie a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n. For <hi>nullum agens poteſt agere, extra Sphar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My third Reaſon you leave untouched, which was this, that the preſent time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all our work, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot juſtifie us for bygones or the future, What is now <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituns,</hi> cannot pay my bygone debt, nor free me for the time to come. And you grant all I have ſaid in the fourth, <hi>that our beſt workes are unperfect, and ſo cannot hold water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal of GOD.</hi> I am glade to hear you grant ſo much, for then where will workes of ſupererogation and merit appear.</p>
            <p>For further clearing of our Doctrine of Juſtification, take notice, the Papiſts and we thus differ. Firſt, They ſay there is a two fold juſtification, one, whereby a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n unjuſt is made juſt; for attaining this, there muſt be previous diſpoſitions by the acts of faith, fear, hope, love, whch fit the man for his juſtification, ſome of them terme this, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum congrui,</hi> others ſay, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at this is the free gift of GOD not deſerved by workes. The ſecond Juſtification, is, that whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

man being juſt is made more juſt: this they ſay is merited by their workes, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>à DEO &amp; arbitrio ſimul,</hi> both from free will and GOD. So <hi>Molina.</hi> Here they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found juſtification and ſanctification; And by this way we are not compleetly juſtified till we die, ere the work of ſanctification be perfected fully, we muſt be Saints in light. Secondly, That free gift of grace, is parted betwixt GOD and free-will, if this Doctrine hold. For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>we co-operat with GOD in juſtification it ſelf, and the beginning of faith.</hi> So by it that emphatick place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. cannot be interpreted aright, it is GOD who juſtifieth. If man had no part nor hand in the Creation, how can he have it in the firſt Converſion, ſeeing that is a new Creation? Thirdly, They make the formal cauſe of juſtification, inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is ragged by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as appeareth from this reflecter. Then it is no fit covering for our nakedneſs, for it ſelf needeth a covering. Can it ſatisfie divine juſtice, being ſo imperfect? <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> telleth the contrar, on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever liveth here, albeit he live righteouſly, if that righteouſneſs be ſtrictly judged, wo to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h of merits and free-will ſay all Papiſts, then poſitively and moſtly thy own.

               </gap> about ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will indeed find it ſafeſt and ſureſt. We again mantain that a converted man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der previous law work of conviction, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, humiliation, and the fallow ground of the heart is thus prepared, and broken up by the plowing of the Word: but a man may come this length and go no further, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions have not alwayes a neceſſar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with that new birth. Nor is the ſeed of faith ſtill ſown in ſuch as are under the ſpirit of bondage. He who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſteth of theſe powers may fall away. There be a relative difference between theſe acts in the Elect and others. Secondly, When faith the free gift of GOD, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. is ſown into the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60150:118"/>
the child to ſeek the breaſts, ſo it leaueth and leadeth the man in its firſt motion, to the righteouſneſs of Jeſus a Mediator, who is <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and he maketh mention of his righteouſneſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his only. The Lord hath ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, <hi>he is made of GOD to us righteouſneſs,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 130. faith apprehendeth that, as the ſhip-broken man doth a plank, whereby he commeth to land; by that we are juſtified before GOD. Inherent graces cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the juſtice of GOD, nor make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the law, nor pay the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty which it requireth. But Mediatory righteouſneſs can do all this. So the cauſes of juſtification are theſe, the final cauſe is the glory of GOD and mans ſalvation. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the favour, mercy, and good will of GOD. The meritorious, the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt. The formal, the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of that bleſſed Mediator. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe or condition, (as ſome word it) is faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. 25. ſo we are juſtified by faith alone, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, and this giveth glory to GOD, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. dethroneth the boaſting of men, and is the ſure ſafe ſcripture way. Now when we ſay that faith alone juſtifieth, by laying hold on his righteouſnes, and applying it, we ſtill hold that faith which juſtifieth to be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60150:118"/>
pregnant with good workes, ſuch as love, heart-cleanſing, new obedience, patience zeal, and other fruits of the ſpirit. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries deny not to us. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth us this much right, for he acknowledgeth that we hold good workes to be neceſſar to the juſtified, <hi>Non neceſſitate efficientiae ſed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiae.</hi> So they juſtifie our faith to ourſelves and others: but faith juſtifieth the man, and workes have no place in that act. We do not deny that good workes have room, and are neceſſarie for working out of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they are <hi>via reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> but in the point of Juſtification they are excluded. Our juſtification is the Lords act of gracious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution tendred to us through Chriſt. When we receive the ſentence, faith the hand of the ſoul layeth only hold of it. And it is not ſaid in Scripture, <hi>love in his blood, or patience, or real in it, but faith in his blood,</hi> by which we are juſtified, cloathed, and covered.

               </label> of Purgatory, which I paſs, and touch reaſon or teſtimonie produced by you. You mention two texts of Scripture, the one is <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 25. where we are commanded to agree with our adverſarie quickly, &amp;c. this place proveth no Purgatory priſon. For firſt, It is allegorick, and ſo cannot be argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, on a controverted point. All that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60150:129"/>
is here intended, is, that brethren ſhould dwel together in love, and forgive other their treſpaſſes againſt them, as is clear from the context. Secondly, If it were meaned of Purgatory, it would make the Lord their adverſarie, they behoved to be delivered up to the Devil, for he is the Jaylor of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Now it is ſtrange divinity to ſay that the Lord is an adverſary, and the Devil a Jaylor, to the man whoſe ſins are forgiven him. Thirdly, If this priſon be Purgatory, then there is commutative juſtice betwixt GOD and man, for ſuch here pay the uttermoſt farthing. And who can ſay to the Lord, <hi>forgive me, have mercy upon me,</hi> and yet be of this judgement, that he can pay all his debt by that mending fire, and not owe any thing to free gracious pardon?</p>

               <hi>the abuſe of the Gospel, which is (to ſay true) all the unity ye have.

Secondly, You pretend that Catholick Romans are more divided then ye, becauſe ſometime the Council is put above the Pope, ſometime the Pope above the Council. But find you this as an article of the Catholick Church? What ever hath been the opinion of ſacred men, yea of Fathers and Councils thereanent, yet they were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed nor owned by the Church for an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick decree. And ſuppoſe both ſentences were decided, it is eaſily anſwered, that the Pope is approved to be above a Council not approved by himſelf, and a Council approved by a Pope is above a Pope alone, wherein there is no diſagreement or contradiction. As for the pragniatick Sanction, as it hath no reference to matters of faith, ſo it maketh nothing for your purpoſe, no more then praedetermination, ſeeing all Catholicks who hold it, think it tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not away free-will. But then you ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unity in all things is not to be expected here. So ye ſhew your ſelves conſcious enough of your own diviſions: and if you underſtand it in matters of faith, it is a blaſphemy againſt</hi>

               <hi>Gods word, which ſaith that there be but</hi> one GOD, one Faith, one Baptiſm. <hi>If one faith, then no diviſion of faith, without which no u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can conſist. So judge you if it be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſoleciſm in reaſon as you ſpeak; but alſo in belief to joyn with the</hi> Grecians <hi>in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, albeit they deny the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt which ye believe, or with the</hi> Lutherians, <hi>who hold the real preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacrament, which ye flatly deny.</hi>

And writting to <hi>John Patriarch of Conſtantinople, epiſt.</hi> 38. <hi>lib.</hi> 4 who did uſurpe that tittle, he calleth him <hi>Rex ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae.</hi> Which title <hi>Boniface</hi> did take on after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by <hi>Phocas</hi> means who killed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and fulfilled the prophecie of <hi>Gregorie.</hi> Neither <hi>John Patriarch of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> nor <hi>Boniface</hi> excluded other Biſhops, as <hi>Eſthius</hi> laboureth by this reply to make evaſion. For both in the Eaſtern and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Churches at that time there were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops whom they acknowledged ſuch. But he is univerſal Biſhop according to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who layeth claim to the univerſal ſupremacy and extolleth himſelf above all, as the Pope now doth in the Church at Rome. I ſhal ſhut up this anſwer, with that famous conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Bernard to Pope Eugenius the</hi> 4. which words <hi>Antonius de Dominis Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Spalato,</hi> citteth for refutation of the Popes ſupremacie, <hi>Politia Eccleſiaſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. the words are theſe, <hi>Hoc quod habuit Petrus hoc dedit, ſolicitudinem quippe ſuper Eccleſias, Dominationem nunquam, audi ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, non Dominantes inquit in clerum,</hi> 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Et ne dictum ſola humilitate, non ettam veritate videatur, vox Domini eſt in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelio.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You would father a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on me, becauſe I regrate our rents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the evil uſe of Goſpell-light, as if we held not one confeſſion of faith. A child may conceive, that the abuſe of Goſpel-light, ſuppoſeth the light, but it is evil uſed practically, and this maketh our breaches in other things. It is beyond controverſie, that the nationall ſtroaks under which we groan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have chiefly proceeded from the evil uſe of the Goſpell. Light hath come amongſt us, but we have walked in darkneſs. Will it therefore follow that we are not one dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically in the orthodox confeſſion of faith. Where is this conſequence founded? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Popedome cure rents, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60150:152"/>
make them. Experience proveth this cure to be the fomenter of the diſeaſe. For ſince his uſurpation, moe controverſies have been ſtarted in the Chriſtian Church then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were heard. And if this wer the cure, it is admirable, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the caſe was in <hi>Corinth</hi> there is no mention of that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You deny that it hath been the ſentence, or deeree oecumenical that the Councill was above the Pope. Was it not expreſly defined by the Councill of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and doth not the 15 Act of the Councill of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> ſay that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge above others from Chriſt. But the reaſon why at any time they had it, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the ſeat of the Roman Empire, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall priviledges with the Pope. Doe not all your <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> preferre the councill to the Pope? and all your Jeſuits the Pope to the Councill? Where is your Unitie then? for as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>In hoc conſiſtit ſumma rei,</hi> viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Popes infallible univerſall ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, without which there is no ſalvation to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ad. Alſo ye make it a fundamental ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of your Creed, which is more then the opinion of privat Doctours. And the very truth is, it is the foundtion and key-ſtone of Popery. <hi>Quo ſublato omnia corruunt,</hi> as he ſaith there in his <hi>Preface to the Treatiſe, de</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:60150:153"/>
               <hi>ſumme Pontiſice. De qua re agitur cum de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matu Pontiſicis agitur? Breviter reſpondeo, de ſumma rei, id enim quaeritur, debe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this giveth no more to a Council then to a Seſſion, for if the Pope approve that, it is above his own ſingle approbation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the additame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to it. The only queſtion is when they differ, whoſe ſentence is to be preferred? And about this ye differ much amongſt your ſelves, conſequently in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, for this is <hi>caput rei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, You quarrel with us for ſaying that perfect unity in all things is not to be expected here. And yet it is expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. founded upon experience. How then call you it blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie? <hi>Unitas in fundamentalibus, libertas in ſupra fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talibus &amp; charitas in omnibus,</hi> is a ſaying much commended by many; and did we blaſpheme by uttering this golden ſentence? We are in charity with the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> and <hi>Greek Church</hi> becauſe they hold the ſame rule with us, viz, the Scripture. The Reformed Churches have a body of Confeſſions, in which they have <hi>Concord,</hi> and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60150:153"/>
we in this Church have one <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and one <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> in which we all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But to think that becauſe of ſome other differences, we are not for one GOD, one Faith, one Baptiſm, it is abſurd to ſpeak ſo.</p>

               <hi>pelf and policie is greater then yours, both which I grant, but glories in neither. Yet if Miniſters augmentations hold on, they will ſhortly equal our pelf, but not our Chriſtian policit, in employing it ſo well; our glorious and goodly edifices of Churches, Hospitals, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, diſperſing and diſtributing their rents to pious uſes. But the thruſting down of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Hospitals, Monaſteries, disperſing and diſſipating their rents, teſtifie your want of policy, blind avarice &amp; mad paſſion. Secondly, You ſay, we give indulgencies for looſeneſs, as if in Catholick times, there had been greater looſeneſs then ſince the Reformation. Whereas the keeping of Lent, and Faſting dayes were aboliſhed, Pennance and ſatisfaction for ſin taken away, Celibacie in Church men thought a crime, Laicks allowed after divorcement to marry, all good works thought impoſſible, the Commandments thought impoſſible to be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that men ſin of neceſſity in their beſt actions, which, as it excuſeth all wickedneſs and ſin; ſo it giveth way to all looſeneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phainneſs.

Marqueſs of Galeacia, <hi>and cloſed on their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril with naked truth in your Church. To which I anſwer, that all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks have quit Rome not in the integritie of their heart, but in the blindneſs of their mind, and that with their own peril, eternal damnation, cloſing with a very naked faith and Religion, not well cloathed with the leaſt colour of truth, but not with naked faith or belief, which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks confidently and conſtantly aſſert, what ever you ſay to the contrar. And it is no where elſe to be found, for they know there is but one faith, and one GOD, and one true Church. Conſequentlie united in the ſame faith, in all which points as ſhe was establiſhed by Chriſt and his Apostles, hath continued ſince their time viſible in her Paſtours and People in all Ages, holy and incorrupted in her Doctrine, religious in her Sacraments and ceremonies, powerful and glorious in her wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, converſion of Infidels, in the which the holy Fathers have lived, and all true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have died. Which only all new upſtarts and Sects do perſecute and oppoſe, as</hi> Proteſtants <hi>at this day, under the pretence of Reformation, and upon the ſame ground of wreſting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, againſt the common conſent of the Church and Fathers with them. For as all diviſions in Chriſtianity have been from the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, ſo all have turned both their</hi>

But we with the ſcripture, forbid men to deceive themſelves, for they who do ſuch things ſhall not it herit the kingdom of heaven. So with us, nothing leſs will ſatisfie then Goſpell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the leaſt ground of hope is not granted to thoſe hereafter, who turne not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hore from their iniquities. How can this be denyed, ſeeing your lateſt Caſuiſts, ſuch as <hi>Eſcobar, Buſenbaius</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> have purpoſly deviſed latitudes for rendring prophane men ſecure about <hi>Duells, Sodomy, and other acts of uncleanneſs,</hi> which would make chaſte ears to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that men who in hainouſly are not bound to repent imediatly, as it is fully proved by Reverend &amp; Learned Mr. MENZIES in his <hi>Papiſmus Lucifugus pag.</hi> 158. to 169. And when it is defended, that <hi>minus probabile,</hi> may be choſen although it have no ground in ſcripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trar to more probable grounds, and the ſtream of Doctors, doth not this open a door to make the may of Chriſtianity broad? whereas the ſcripture calleth it ſtrait and narrow.

And to me it is not <hi>minus probabile,</hi> that it is only upon this account. We are not againſt <hi>faſting, chaſtity, mortification.</hi> Nor do we ſay, <hi>that men ſin not willingly, or that good workes are impoſſible,</hi> yea we hold them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar to ſalvation. Only we deny that faln man can be juſtified by the workes of the law, otherwiſe we needed not a Saviour not a Goſpell-remedy. It is your ordinar way to miſtate queſtions and then intend a skirmiſh which is eaſie work; this is a ſinfull and ſhallow evaſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You fall out with bauling expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which rational men cannot value much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fe at theſe worthies, who did take their lives in their hands, and cloſed with perſecuted truth, neither for gaine nor for honor, but for conſcience ſake. Was not this a commendable duty? If ſelf denyall be not a chief ingredient in Chriſtian performances I know not the Goſpell. You aſſert that it was blindneſs not integrity. I averſe, it was integrity and not blindneſs; <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant?</hi> remember thou ſhalt be judged. You talk much concerning the authority and unity which is amongſt you but ſome who were at Rome, and have come not long ago from you to us againe, tell, what ſort of integritie, puritie and chaſtitie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you. So it is no wonder albeit many

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, You imply that none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but ſuch as are ſubject to the Pope. Therefore our run-awayes muſt nor be apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats with you; for they are Prodigals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and loſt ſheep found. When I pray you went they from you to us? Were they not baptized in our Church, and partakers of all ordinances with us till of late? Then I poſe you and them again, whither ye damn all who are not Popiſh, and judge them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted? If they be Hereticks, in your ſenſe this muſt follow. Yet you have nor the confidence to ſpeak it directly. And ſure I am, Scripture requireth not <hi>ſubjection to the Pope,</hi> as an article of the Creed.

               </gap> man cannot be ſaved, albeit he believe, and live like the Goſpel, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was no choſen Veſſel, which is contrar to Scripture; there was no Pope in his dayes, nor long after that. Your Church hath been viſible by bell, book, and candle, fire, fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, pomp, policie. Your Paſtours are more for the fleece then the flock.

               </gap> by fopperies and military Compulſators. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Apoſtles, and ſome primitive Fathers were Martyrs, but they died not in the Romiſh Faith as it is now mantained. And how can your Church be called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which is a particular one, wherein be many diſſenters? It is not ſtrange to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ye indulge them who runne away, and Apoſtatize from us, but it is ſtrange why they have done ſo, and what hath ſaſcinated them to burſt all bonds and ſwallow on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the whole bulk of Popery. It requireth an Oſtrich ſtomach to digeſt ſuch iron. Where in did Goſpel-truths, Goſpel-worſhip, or their mother and nurſe weary them, teſtifie againſt her if they can?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You ſay, <hi>we have Faith without u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> then you grant us faith, and our unity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in fundamentals is more then your own. <hi>A Church without a head.</hi> We acknowledge no Pope head of our Church, Chriſt is our head, and the viſible Government of the Church
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60150:160"/>
is Ariſtocratical, not Monarchical, the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Members of his Body are united in him; <hi>ſo we are not a body without united members.</hi> Neither want we a Judge in controverſal matters.

inſtruments to ſeal and ſanctifie, our rule is infallible, for it is Scripture; the grounds of our faith are ſuch as will not make us aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for we have his revealed will and word for it.
